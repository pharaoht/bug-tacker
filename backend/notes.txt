Javascript is a single threaded language.
Javascript is a intrepret language. (Depends on the implentation)


With an interpreter, we translate and read the files line by line on the fly
Compiler is like an interpreter, but doesnt translate on the fly. Worked ahead of time to create a translation of what code we've just written

Con of interpreter is that it can get slow over time after many iterations
Con of Compiler is that, it takes longer to get up and running because it has to read the code first before executing

Pro of Compiler is that it will eventually run faster with many iterations, it optimizes the code



Javascript Engine (Jit Compiler, best of both worlds)

Parser -> Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) -> Interpreter -> Profiler -> Compiler -> Optimized code
